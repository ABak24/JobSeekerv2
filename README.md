# JobSeekerv2

The goal of this work is to develop a job supply and demand mobile application -- a system that allows users to view and contact potential workers or employers (firms). The application consists of two parts: Server application and Android applications. The server part of the application is realized using the Firebase platform that allows remote access to data on the Real-time database, but also takes care of user authentication and restricting data access. The Android part of the application allows manipulation and access to data obtained from the database (server). The application is based on 2 types of users (profiles): worker and employer (company). Based on the profile selection, an interface is created dynamically.


## Short description

•	Job seeker is a system that enables simple supply and demand of work services, thus making the recruitment process simpler and more efficient. Job seeker connects all workers and employers in one place and gives an insight into the current labor market. Job seeker offers employers a simpler find of workers with publishing job posts within few clicks. It also offers workers the display of active job advertisements with the ability to contact the employer.

•	The system is realized within the framework of the Android application in which all functions from communication with the database, ways of accessing the system (authentication), creating profiles and ads, and user interface are implemented.
